The key benefits are:
- Always up to date specification;
- Better developer experience;
- Enforcement of API Governance;
- Reduce duplicated functionalities;
- Cohesive documentation and standards;
- Leverage DevOps to speed-up development;
- Decreased development effort by generation code based on  documentation;
